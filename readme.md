# WebLinks

WebLinks is web-application that gives the Shaarli Bookmarks utility some extra features and a lot more speed.

Shaarli is the personal, minimalist, super-fast, database free, bookmarking service. It gives you the option to save and share the links you discover. Shaarli is a bookmark manager and link sharing service that you can install on your own server. It is designed to be personal (single-user), fast and handy.

You can find all the information on Shaarli on https://shaarli.readthedocs.io/en/master/. It's a friendly fork of the original Shaarli project by SÃ©bastien Sauvage. It is now maintained by the Shaarli community at github.com/shaarli.

WebLinks uses the api-interface of Shaarli to exchange information with your shaarli-server. The first time you have to set the url to your server and the api-secret. The app will then synchronize in the background with your server. All the weblinks are stored in the local storage of your webbrowser, which makes the app really fast.

After you have installed the app you are connected my Shaarli demo-site. You can see if it all works, but the information on this site is refreshed every 30 minutes. If you are satisfied you can enter your own url-link and secret in the settings-menu.
